"""Build the pooled master from this repository and its siblings.

Everything a consumer needs to group across states, in one declared schema, with
every row still pointing at the page it was read from.

Three things this is careful about, each because getting it wrong would look
like success:

  reconcile()   every input row becomes an output row or a line in
                master_dropped.csv with a reason. It is the only check that can
                catch an adapter silently losing rows, because a row count that
                went down for a good reason and one that went down for a bad
                reason look identical.

  partitioning  one file per state. The pack here is already 1.9 GiB; a single
                master rewritten on every build adds a fresh blob each time even
                when one state changed.

  urban         excluded by canon.RURAL_TIERS and counted, not quietly dropped.
                Kerala ships urban wards in the same file as rural ones, so
                this cannot be done by choosing files.

Siblings are read from ROOT.parent, never vendored, and their git commit is
recorded on every row.

    `paths` narrows the question from "what is HEAD" to "when did the inputs last
    change", and for this repository that distinction is the difference between a
    build that settles and one that cannot. Stamping HEAD meant every row of the
    six states parsed here changed whenever any commit landed - including the
    commit that recorded the rows themselves, and the manifest rebuild after it.
    `make release-check` could therefore never pass: it rebuilds the master,
    which dirtied the tree it was about to check for cleanliness, and committing
    that dirtied it again.

    Asking when the sources and parsers last changed is also the more useful
    answer. A row says which version of the inputs produced it, rather than which
    unrelated commit happened to be checked out when someone ran the build.

    Not a space optimisation, though it is one. `candidates_bihar.csv` is 208 MB
    and GitHub refuses any file over 100 MB outright, so the corpus could not be
    pushed at all. The reason to prefer parquet over the gzipped CSV it replaces
    is that reading a state table drops from 0.80 s to 0.06 s: these tables exist
    to be grouped across, and a consumer pays that cost every time.

    **Types come from dictionary.py, never from inference.** The dictionary
    already declares what every column is, and it is what `make expect` checks
    against, so a file that types its columns differently would contradict the
    repository's own definition of them. Inference is the thing to avoid, not
    types: it would read a ward number of `07` as the integer 7 in the states
    that print leading zeros and leave it a string in the states that do not,
    and the same column would then have different types in different files.

    Typing buys something CSV cannot express at all: **null is not blank**.
    `woman_reserved` being unknown and `woman_reserved` being false are
    different facts here - that distinction is what `gender_stated` exists to
    protect - and in a CSV they are both the empty string.

    A value that will not cast **stops the build**. That is the whole point: the
    alternative is a silent null, and a seat whose number quietly became missing
    looks exactly like a seat that never had one. Two such columns were found
    the first time this ran - Uttarakhand writing "17-गुलडिया" into `seat_no`
    and Goa writing "Unopposed" into `votes` - and both were real defects in the
    sources' parsers rather than reasons to loosen the type.

    The parquet analogue of gzip's timestamp problem, and the reason
    `requirements.txt` pins pyarrow: two writes of the same table are
    byte-identical, but the footer records `created_by: parquet-cpp-arrow
    version <x>`. Upgrading pyarrow therefore changes every SHA-256 in the
    manifest with no data change, and `make verify` would report the whole
    corpus altered. The manifest records the writer version so that reads as
    what it is rather than as data drift.
