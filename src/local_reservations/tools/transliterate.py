"""Transliterate the corpus's Indic names into Latin, as a stage of its own.

    uv run --with indicate python -m local_reservations.tools.transliterate
    uv run --with indicate python -m local_reservations.tools.transliterate --check

Two fifths of this corpus is not in Latin script - 328,539 rows of Devanagari,
4,366 of Kannada - so those names cannot be searched, joined, or compared
against any external register. This turns them into something a reader outside
the source language can use.

**Why a stage and not a step inside a parser.** Kruti Dev decoding happens
inline in Jharkhand's parser today, and that is exactly why `script` had to be
corrected mid-parse rather than stated once. Collection, parsing and
transliteration answer different questions - what does the state publish, what
does this document say, and what is that name in Latin - and folding the third
into the second means it cannot be re-run, re-checked or improved on its own.
The pipeline is collect -> parse -> transliterate -> pool.

**Why a committed table and not a build step.** A release pins a SHA-256 for
every file. Transliterating during the build would put a model in the path of
every hash, so a library upgrade would rewrite the corpus without changing a
value - the same argument that pins pyarrow. This writes a lookup table, the
table is committed, and the master build only ever reads it. Same reasoning as
data/jharkhand/ocr/.

**Why a table and not a column.** Names repeat: 328,539 Devanagari rows hold
158,931 distinct strings. Keying on the string rather than the row means the
work is done once per name, the output is diffable, and a correction to one
name fixes every row that carries it.

`indicate`'s offline PyTorch backend is used rather than its LLM one, and the
reason is reproducibility rather than cost: it is deterministic - the same
input gives the same output across runs, checked - where an LLM is not, and a
non-deterministic stage cannot sit behind a manifest.

Nothing here replaces what a source printed. `winner` stays as the gazette set
it; the Latin form travels beside it, the way party_local sits beside party.
