"""Write a readme into every state directory under data/.

The top-level readme answers "what does this repository hold". It cannot answer
"what is in this directory, where did it come from, and what should I not do
with it" without becoming unreadable, and that is the question someone has who
has landed in data/jk/ from a search result or a file listing.

Everything here is derived from the files themselves - row counts, women's
shares, districts, the source documents each row cites, the caveats. Nothing is
typed in that could drift out of step with the data, which is the same reason
the top-level tables are generated. The one hand-written part is the paragraph
saying what makes each state's sources awkward, in STATE_NOTES, because that is
knowledge about documents rather than a fact derivable from the parsed rows.

Run with `make state-readmes`, or `--check` to fail when a file on disk differs
from what would be generated now.

STATE_NOTES = {
    "assam": f"""The 2020 notification contains two reservation rosters: wards
and municipal-board chairpersons. It prints only the reserved seats. The ward
table also prints each board's total number of wards, but not the identifiers
of the open wards; those seats are therefore not invented in the output, and
`listing_scope` is `reserved_only` on every row.

The PDF is a scan with a misleading hidden OCR layer. Its 81 ward-summary rows
and 46 chairperson rows are checked transcriptions tied to the committed PDF's
SHA-256, with page provenance on every emitted seat. The board totals reconcile
to the notification's own grand total of 1,004 wards.

The separate `2025_reservation` source series contains {ASSAM_HELD} district PRI
notifications acquired from the Assam State Election Commission.
{ASSAM_PARSED_LABEL} are parsed, not a
statewide claim. Charaideo's 36 GPs span four Anchalik Panchayats; its left table keeps
the printed SC/ST ward counts, including zeroes and twos. Kamrup Metropolitan's
20 GPs span three Anchalik Panchayats; its notification explicitly labels every
office and all 200 named ward rows, including Unreserved seats. South
Salmara-Mankachar adds a complete 35-GP and 350-ward universe; all 175 names
printed for women-reserved wards are retained, while GP-to-AP membership stays
blank because that source does not print the crosswalk. Hailakandi contributes
a 62-GP left table across five Anchalik Panchayats and 459 identifiable reserved
seats. Its notification omits open seats, so those are not invented and its
unknown all-ward counts stay blank. Seven child seat tables contain 1,678 stated
seats across the {ASSAM_PARSED} districts. Acquisition, OCR, parsing, and
validation are separate stages. The remaining {ASSAM_UNPARSED} district PDFs
stay visible as held, unparsed
work. Four supporting final-delimitation gazettes preserve the official AP, GP,
development-block, and ZPC hierarchy used to review Hailakandi.

Some source pages contain administrative contact details; derived election
tables whitelist election fields and do not carry phone numbers or other
incidental personal data.""",
    "ap": """All 13 district GP-reservation gazettes are held. Eight have
passed extraction, parsing, and validation; the other five remain acquired but
unparsed. Acquisition, text extraction/OCR, and parsing are separate stages.
`extract.py` retains usable embedded text, `ocr.py` re-reads scans from 300 DPI
renders, and the parser consumes only those retained artifacts. A newly held
PDF therefore cannot silently enter the published rows merely because its
hidden text contains something category-like.

The source layouts differ. Kurnool is a ruled GP-by-ward table with usable
embedded text. Several earlier districts require positional OCR; they do not
agree on column order, and Krishna itself puts the ward count on opposite sides
of the Sarpanch cell on adjacent pages. Where no line marks the boundary between
the mandal and panchayat, it is recovered from the order of the records.

Kadapa is read from retained word coordinates because the scan is skewed and
its hidden text order does not preserve the table. Its 807 GP rows and 50
mandals are checked against the three abstracts printed in the same gazette.
Pages 56–57 then supply a separate errata layer: all 41 `For` values must agree
with the original table before the `Read as` values are applied. Corrected rows
retain both printed values and the correction page.

Two consequences worth knowing before using this. `ocr_repaired` counts the
mends a row's category cell needed - a wrong mend looks exactly like a right
one, so those rows stay findable rather than being quietly trusted. And
Anantapur states each sarpanch seat twice, in two separately typeset proformas;
the file holds their deduplicated union, `printings` records how many
statements stood behind each row, and `printings_agree` records whether they
said the same thing.""",
    "goa": """Goa publishes ward-level reservation for village panchayats. The
2012 cycle names the winner; 2017 and 2022 are nomination-stage listings and
name nobody, which is a property of the document rather than a gap in the
parse. Ward numbers arrive in five different shapes, including one with a soft
hyphen inside it (`Ward­IV`), so they are normalized rather than read
literally.""",
    "gujarat": """The 2020 rotation orders display Gujarati correctly but their
hidden text layer is a misencoded glyph stream. Acquisition, OCR, and parsing
are separate stages: the raw cell readings remain in `ocr/*.jsonl`, while the
two parsed files standardise only the reservation category and retain the
source-script constituency name.

The holdings contain multiple administrative layers rather than treating a
state as a single table: 16 district-panchayat orders and 29 taluka-panchayat
orders, with district and body recorded in the source manifest. Five
low-contrast constituency cells that neither page-wide nor isolated-cell OCR
could read were transcribed from their rendered source pages and are marked as
reviewed readings in the raw JSONL.""",
    "karnataka": """Two very different sources sit under this state. The
1993-2007 gram panchayat rows come from a Stata file, a reservation history
that names no winner in any cycle because it is a roster rather than a result.
The 2016 taluk and zilla panchayat rows come from 195 notifications harvested
from the web archive's copy of `karsec.gov.in`; every one of them is a copier
scan with no text layer, read with Surya, and they carry the party the winner
represented, which almost nothing else in this corpus does.

**Two further groups of documents were harvested, are committed here, and are
deliberately not parsed.** Saying so is the point of this paragraph: they are
not a gap and nobody needs to look at them again.

`tzp_2016_reservation` is 211 files of seat-level reservation for the same 2016
seats the notifications cover - and the notifications' own third column already
states the reservation, so reading these would produce a second opinion on a
field we have rather than a new field.

`gp_2015` is 33 files in which nobody is named. Form-1 counts nomination papers
received, Form-2 those valid after scrutiny, Form-3 the candidates left in the
fray, Form-5 turnout, and the file called `Result.pdf` is Form-4 - the final
count including unopposed wins, but as district x taluk x 26 numeric columns.
The one thing in it worth knowing about is that those per-taluk counts of seats
and members elected by category are the shape of an external denominator, and
they come from the commission that ran the election rather than from the LGD
register. That is a different job from parsing seats.

Both groups keep their manifests, so any file can be traced to the URL and
capture it came from, and re-read by anyone who disagrees with this.""",
    "jharkhand": """Place names are printed in Kruti Dev, a legacy font
encoding rather than Unicode, and are shipped as they were printed - `script`
says so on every row. They are not transliterated, so joining these to another
source on name will not work without transliterating first.

The filenames do not reliably say which tier a file holds, so tier is decided
from the contents. A third of the PDFs have no ruling lines at all.""",

corpus, and there is no reliable published total to measure them against, so
no completeness figure is quoted - an invented denominator would be worse than
admitting there is not one.

a fact about which pages were published, not about J&K, and `listing_scope`
marks every such row. Do not compute shares across it.""",
