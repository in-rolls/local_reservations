"""Generate the coverage table in README.md, and check that its links work.

The readme is the index of record for this whole family of repos, and it has
drifted twice already: Haryana sat blank after being built, `data/karnatka/` was
a typo nobody caught, and ten states had raw documents on disk while their rows
said nothing. A hand-maintained index will drift again, so it is generated.

Three sources feed it:

  * **parsed datasets** in `data/<state>/`, identified by their columns rather
    than their filenames - `jharkhand data 2010_reservation_pop_for web.csv` is
    a pre-existing file that matches any sensible filename glob but is not one
    of ours;
  * **raw holdings** from `data/inventory.csv`, so a state with documents but no
    parser reads "raw, unparsed" instead of looking empty;
  * **sibling repos**, for the states that were split out.

Every link is verified: relative paths must exist on disk and http(s) links must
answer 200. `--check` exits non-zero on a dead link, so this can gate the index
the same way the validate scripts gate the data.
