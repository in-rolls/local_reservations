"""Fetch archived documents for any host, as crawled, with a manifest.

        --dry-run

`archive_sweep.py` says what exists; this brings it here. The two halves are
deliberately separate - the sweep downloads nothing and can be re-run against
every state cheaply, and nothing is fetched until somebody has read its output
and decided a directory is worth the bytes.

Written general because the alternative was another copy. `ap/harvest.py` was
one state's CDX query wrapped in a hundred lines of fetch-and-check, and the
only parts of it that were about Andhra Pradesh were the query and the district
names. Karnataka would have been a second copy, and the sweep resolves 23
states.

Three properties are worth more than the convenience:

**The bytes are as crawled.** The `id_` form of the Wayback URL returns the
original response without the archive's banner, so a PDF is the PDF the
commission published rather than a page about it.

**A file already here is a check, not an obstacle.** If our copy and the
archive's differ, that is a finding and the run says so; it never overwrites.

**Nothing is trusted that is not written down.** Every file lands in a manifest
with the URL it came from, the capture timestamp and a SHA-256, because a
directory of PDFs with no provenance is not evidence of anything.
