"""What the web archive holds for every state election commission.

    uv run python -m local_reservations.tools.archive_sweep            # every state
    uv run python -m local_reservations.tools.archive_sweep --only Karnataka

Written because the corpus's largest recent find was an accident. Chasing an
unrelated question, a query against the whole of karsec.gov.in returned 828
archived PDFs including 196 taluk panchayat elected-member gazettes for 2016 -
a tier Karnataka contributes nothing to, naming winners, sitting in a public
archive. Nothing here would have found it: probe_sources.py reads eighteen
hand-picked URLs and none is a commission's site, and ap/harvest.py queries the
archive for one hard-coded path in one state.

So this asks every state the same question and writes the answer down. It
**downloads nothing**; it is an inventory, and its output is the input to a
decision about what is worth harvesting.

The host is derived rather than curated. Commissions name their sites on a few
patterns - karsec.gov.in, sec.gujarat.gov.in, wbsec.gov.in,
mahasec.maharashtra.gov.in - and generating candidates from those resolved seven
of the first eight states tried. Every candidate is recorded, not only the one
that answered: a state reported as holding nothing looks identical to a state
whose domain was guessed wrong, and that difference is the whole value of the
file.
