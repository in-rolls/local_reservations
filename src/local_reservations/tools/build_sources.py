"""Keep SOURCES.md's holdings table true to what is on disk.

SOURCES.md is a feasibility survey and most of it is judgement - whether a
state is worth building, what its documents turned out to be, what OCR would
cost. That stays hand-written. What does not stay hand-written is the count of
files and pages, because that is a fact about the directory and it drifted:
Karnataka's row read "1 scan, 7 pages" on the day the repository held 439
documents and 1,545 pages of them.

So the numbers come from data/inventory.csv and the sentence describing each
state stays here, in HELD, for the same reason build_state_readmes keeps
STATE_NOTES - it is knowledge about documents rather than a fact derivable from
them.
