"""Pin the corpus, so a citation means one thing.

Without this there is no way to say "the data as of March". A tag alone is not
enough either: it pins this repository's tree, but the master is built from
siblings that live elsewhere and move on their own schedule, so a row's origin
is only reproducible if the sibling's commit is written down beside it.

Writes MANIFEST.json (the record) and MANIFEST.md (the same thing readable).

**Two builds from the same tree must be byte-identical**, or verification fails
on somebody else's machine for no reason. That rules out a wall-clock timestamp,
so the manifest is dated by the git commit rather than by when it was generated.
It also rules out trusting a dirty sibling: rows attributed to a commit did not
come from that commit, so `dirty` is recorded and release-check refuses.
