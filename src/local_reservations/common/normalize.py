"""Read a reservation label, whatever shape the state prints it in.

Generalised from local_elections_haryana/scripts/normalize.py. Every state
publishes the same two facts - which caste category a seat is reserved for, and
whether it is reserved for a woman - but no two print them alike:

    Haryana    "Scheduled Caste Other than Women", or Kruti Dev
               "vuqlwfpr tkfr efgyk ds flok;"
    Goa        codes in one cell: G, ST, OBC, W, OBCW, STW
    Jharkhand  two separate columns: "vuqlwfpr tutkfr" and "efgyk"/"vU;"
    J&K        "Open", "Women", "SC", "ST", "OC"
    Andhra     OCR'd codes: UR, SC, BC, ST, with "(W)" - and "5C", "8c"

So the module exposes the two facts separately - caste_of() and woman_of() -
and normalize_reservation() for the states that print both in one cell. States
whose caste and gender live in different columns call the two directly.

Output is always caste_reservation in {SC, ST, BC, NONE} and woman_reserved in
{0, 1}. BC covers Backward Class, BC(A) and OBC; the states do not agree on the
name and the distinction is not recoverable from the label anyway.

The failure mode this guards against is not an exception. An unmatched spelling
silently downgrades a reserved seat to an open one, which looks entirely
plausible in the output. That is why matching is deliberately loose and why
every observed string is pinned in test_normalize.py.
