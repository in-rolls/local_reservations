"""Turn a state's rows into the pooled schema.

The master's point is that you can group by it, so its columns are fixed and
declared rather than a union of whatever each state happens to carry. The 23
state-specific extras stay out and go to master_extras.parquet long-form, so nothing
is lost and the table does not become mostly blank.

**What is deliberately not carried.** Three sources publish contact details for
named individuals - Bihar a mobile number, postal address and email for each of
645,605 candidates, Kerala an address, phone, mobile and photograph for each of
its 65,296 elected members, Uttar Pradesh 2010 an address. Those columns are
read and dropped, and this is the one place in the repository where dropping
data is not a defect to be fixed. Everything else a source states about a person
is kept: name, relation, gender, age, caste, education, occupation, marital
status, party, votes.

**A reservation is a property of the seat, never of the person who won it.**
`caste_reservation` and `woman_reserved` say what the seat was reserved for.
The winner's own category and gender are `winner_caste` and `winner_gender` on a
seat row, and `candidate_caste` and `candidate_gender` in the candidate table.
They are different facts and the data says so: Uttar Pradesh 2005 states both,
and they agree on 19,324 of 51,872 rows. A scheduled-caste person winning an
unreserved seat is the thing most of these data exist to measure, and collapsing
the two columns would delete it.

Three columns exist because one could not carry the fact:

  tier / tier_local              the same office is printed under different
                                 names, and the same name means different
                                 offices - see canon.py
  caste_reservation / _local /   the fold to BC is lossy and not the same fold
  caste_scheme                   in every state, so the local label and the
                                 regime are both kept
  unit_of_observation /          three sources are candidate-level and get
  seat_candidates                collapsed to seats; a row that came from a
                                 collapse has to say so

The grain is **one row per seat-event as a source states it**. Most sources name
only a cycle, so year identifies the event; Rajasthan also names general and
by-election periods, which remain separate. Rows that still do not identify a
distinct event are exported rather than hidden behind a claim the data does not
support.
