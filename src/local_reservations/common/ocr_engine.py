"""Surya, driven the same way for every state that needs it.

Imported by scripts/<state>/ocr.py. Only the paths and the "does this document
need OCR at all" test are per-state; the rendering, the rotation and the model
are not, and were on their way to being copied a second time.

**Runs in its own uv dependency group.** savitr pins pillow<11 where pdfplumber
needs >=12.2, so the OCR and parsing dependencies cannot share an interpreter.
Nothing here imports anything else from common, so the isolated OCR environment
contains only what the model needs.

Named `ocr_engine` and not `surya`: this directory goes on sys.path[0], and a
module called `surya` here would shadow the real surya package for savitr.
