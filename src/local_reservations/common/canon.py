"""The cross-state vocabulary: what an office is, and what a caste category means.

States print the same office under different names and different offices under
the same name. Pooling on the printed name is therefore not a naming
inconvenience, it is a correctness problem, and it fails silently - the row
counts stay plausible either way.

The one that proves it: **Bihar's "Sarpanch" is not the head of the gram
panchayat.** It heads the *gram kachahari*, the village court, which is a
separate elected body sharing the same geography. Bihar's gram panchayat head is
the Mukhiya. 7,849 panchayats hold both contests, and 88,868 wards hold both a
panch and a ward-member contest. Map Bihar's sarpanch onto Haryana's and a
pooled count of gram panchayat heads gains 7,849 seats that are not gram
panchayat heads at all - a 6% overstatement with nothing anywhere to flag it.

So every row carries two columns: `tier`, the canonical office, and
`tier_local`, the name the state actually printed. Nothing is lost, and anyone
who wants to group by the local vocabulary still can.
