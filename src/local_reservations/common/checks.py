"""A validation battery every state runs, so a pooled dataset is not assembled
from files checked to four different standards.

Each state was validated against its own quirks while it was being built, which
was the right way to get them out but leaves no common floor. This module is
that floor. States keep their own substantive checks - Goa's cross-cycle ward
set, J&K's populations, AP's OCR repairs - and add them on top.

Three layers, in increasing order of how much they can actually catch:

  structural   cheap, mechanical, and true of every state. Cannot catch a
               misread category, but catches a shifted column, a lost key, a
               row counted twice.
  coverage     did we get everything the sources hold, and where we did not, is
               that the source's limit or ours.
  substantive  appeals to something outside the data - a published total, a
               statutory share, a population. These are the only checks that
               reliably catch silent corruption, because every parser bug in
               this repo produced plausible values rather than an error.
