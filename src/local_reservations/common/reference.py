"""Published figures used as denominators, with where each one comes from.

These were scattered across four validators. Keeping them together matters
because they are not all the same kind of number, and the last time that was
treated casually it produced a real error: Haryana's 2022 figure was announced
before polling and counts *seats*, while its 2016 figure was published afterwards
and counts *people elected*. Comparing seat rows against the second made 2016
look like a 102% over-count.

So every entry records its `basis`:

    seats     the number of seats to be filled, announced before the election
    elected   the number of people returned, published after - excludes seats
              left vacant or countermanded, so vacant rows must be dropped
              before comparing

`None` is a real answer. J&K has no reliable published total for its panchayat
seats and its holdings are an ad-hoc subset rather than a corpus, so inventing a
denominator there would be worse than admitting there isn't one.
