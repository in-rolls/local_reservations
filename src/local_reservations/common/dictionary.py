"""What every column is supposed to look like.

One declaration per column, and it is the single source of truth for two things:
the expectations that get checked, and DICTIONARY.md, which is generated from
these entries. Documentation written separately from the rules it describes
drifts away from them - the readme in this repo did exactly that, twice.

The declarations are worth writing because every check in this repo up to now
was written to catch a problem someone had already hit. Declaring what a column
*should* be finds the ones nobody thought to look for: profiling against a first
draft of this file turned up an Andhra Pradesh ward count of 76 (the source says
at most 20), gram panchayat names holding "D. theemavaram 10 sr(w) sr(w)", and
Goa rows with no provenance at all.

`range` and `length` are the two that earn their keep. A column can be the right
type, non-blank, and still obviously wrong.
