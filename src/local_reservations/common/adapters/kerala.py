"""Kerala, from local_elections_kerala.

Three cycles - 2010, 2015, 2020 - across the three rural tiers plus the urban
bodies, all in one file, one row per elected seat. Kerala reserves for scheduled
castes and tribes and for women, and for no backward class at all, which is the
law rather than a gap; `canon.CASTE_SCHEME` declares it as `sc_st_only` so a
zero backward-class count passes here and would fail in Goa.

**`Role` is not a tier.** The plan this adapter was written against assumed the
`President` and `Vice President` rows were a gram panchayat head tier whose
reservation might be the office's rather than the ward's. The file settles it:
all 48,514 gram panchayat rows are unique on (year, district, panchayat, ward),
so a President row *is* a ward row - the member elected from ward 8 who also
holds the presidency - and its `Reservation` is that ward's. Reading `Role` as a
tier would both pool an indirectly elected office with directly elected heads
and count 3,670 wards twice. Every row here is the ward it was elected from, and
`Role` goes to the extras, where the presidency stays recoverable.

**The overlapping files resolve exactly.** The standalone 2015 file holds 16,558
rows and the 2015 fix file 5,245; together 21,803, which is precisely what the
combined file holds for 2015. The combined file already incorporates the fix, so
it is the one read and the other two are not.

**Every district panchayat row names the wrong district, and that is repaired
here rather than carried.** All 993 `District`-type rows across the three cycles
carry `Thiruvananthapuram` - the scrape wrote the district it started on onto
every one of them. `coverage_vs_published` is what caught it: 1 body against the
14 the commission published. No internal check could have, because the column is
perfectly well-formed.

The 14 district panchayats are still there, in order: the ward numbers restart 13
times. Naming them is done by appealing to something outside the broken column -
each group's ward names are matched against the panchayat tier's own district
labels, which are correct - and every group resolves, to Kerala's canonical
south-to-north order, independently in all three cycles. A group that does not
resolve keeps the value the file gave it and is flagged.

**2005 carries no reservation.** Its file is an unpivoted table whose columns are
`Ward No`, `Elected Members`, `Front` and `Votes`, with header rows left in the
body. There is nothing about reservation in it to parse, which is a property of
the source rather than work outstanding.

Provenance is `dataset`: the scrape recorded no document and no page.
