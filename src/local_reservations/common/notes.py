"""What is wrong with a slice, and whether anyone can do anything about it.

The readme's per-slice table carried its caveats as free text in a Notes column,
which mixed two things that need separating:

  - facts about what a document contains, which no amount of work on *that
    document* changes; and
  - places where the document contains more than our parse recovered.

Read together they are background noise. Read apart, the second list is a
worklist. So a note is a declaration with a **status**:

    SOURCE_PROPERTY   the document says what it says. Nothing to do.
    OPEN_GAP          the document holds more than we took. `closes_with` says
                      what would close it.
    UNDETERMINED      we have not established which of the two it is - and that
                      is itself the work.

`UNDETERMINED` is the honest third answer and it earns its place. "No winner was
published" is a claim about the universe of documents, not about the file in
hand; asserting it as a source property is asserting something nobody checked.

Every note is detected from the rows, so a note cannot be marked done while the
condition still holds, and cannot linger once it stops holding. Fix Jharkhand's
image-only column and the line disappears from WORKLIST.md on the next build.
