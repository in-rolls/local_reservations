"""Check the parsed Jharkhand reservation data.

The important distinction this draws is between the two reasons a district is
missing:

  * its documents are scans, so nothing can be read without OCR - a source
    ceiling, not a defect in the parser;
  * its documents are text and still produced nothing - our bug.

Conflating the two would make the parser look finished when it is not, which is
how the first pass looked fine at 10 of 24 districts.
