"""Read the seat identifiers that Jharkhand printed as pictures.

On three pages of the Lohardaga notification the whole seat column is embedded
images rather than text - 40 of them per page - so pdfplumber sees only the
district's roman numeral and 121 rows end up identifying no seat at all. They
are the largest single key collision in the corpus.

The information is not missing. Those images render clean Unicode Devanagari,
easier to read than the Kruti Dev the rest of the state is printed in:

    XVII लोहरदगा /6/1/ अलौदी - (6)
         district  block/gp  panchayat  ward

Koderma is the same defect on a larger scale: pages 30-35 of its notification
carry 33 to 51 images each against 32 to 50 rows that identify nothing, and
every one of those rows reads "VI" because the roman numeral is all the text
layer kept. It was missed here for years because this file used to match a
bespoke regex written against Lohardaga's "/6/1/ अलौदी - (6)", while Koderma
prints the same identifier as "कोडरमा/5/9 – योगियाटिल्हा", with @ and & where
Lohardaga has slashes.

So the identifier is no longer matched here at all. It goes through
`parse.split_seat_id`, the same reader every other path in this state uses,
which already knows all five ways the typesetters bracket a number.

**This used to say the numbers could not be read.** Under tesseract they could
not - "10 comes back as 20, 11 as 2, 12 as 22" - so the ward number was derived
from the document's own ordering, the largest piece of guesswork in this
repository. Surya reads them: a Koderma page returns 48 of 48 identifiers with
the gram panchayat numbers running 8,9,10...23 unbroken. The ordering fallback
is gone, and with it the risk that a row lost to OCR shifts every seat after it.

Writes data/jharkhand/2015/image_seats.csv, which parse.py reads. Cached and
committed, because OCR is slow and its output should be reviewable rather than
regenerated silently on every parse.

Runs under the repository's interpreter, unlike ocr.py: finding the pages needs
pdfplumber and reading them needs the model, and those two cannot share an
interpreter, so the model is reached by handing a directory of rendered pages to
surya_pages.py under savitr's.
