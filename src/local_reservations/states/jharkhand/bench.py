"""Measure the Jharkhand parse against a recorded baseline.

Written because this branch's OCR change passed every check it had and still
shipped a 1,094-row regression into a tier nobody was watching. The gates that
found it were run by hand, after the fact, on snapshots kept in /tmp. A baseline
that lives in a scratch directory is a baseline that disagrees with the next
session.

Three splits, fixed here so they cannot drift:

  DIAGNOSE    documents opened and read while forming a hypothesis. They may be
              stared at, so an improvement here is not evidence of anything.
  VALIDATE    scanned documents never inspected. This is where a recovery has
              to show up.
  REGRESSION  the digital-text documents, which no OCR change touches. They are
              the collateral-damage guard: every parser rule here runs through
              code the whole corpus shares, so a rule tuned on a scan can break
              a district that was already correct. Nothing here may move.

Metrics are soundness, not fill. A row counts only when its seat identity is
*complete for its tier* - a panchayat samiti seat has no gram panchayat and
demanding one scored four correct pages at zero the first time this was
measured. Removing a wrong value is therefore neutral, replacing it with a right
one is a gain, and inventing a plausible wrong one is a loss.

`coverage_distance` scores closeness to the published seat count rather than
coverage itself, because coverage is a ratio with a target of 1.0 and overshoot
is not success: the mukhiya file this replaces read 102% of the gram panchayats
Jharkhand has, which is not 2% better than perfect, it is impossible. A gate on
raw coverage rewards the inflation and rejects the fix.

    Not "documents that have been OCR'd" - every document has now, and defining
    the split that way emptied it the moment the last one finished, so the gate
    that guards against collateral damage silently guarded nothing.

    The question the splits need is which reader a document's rows come from,
    which is the one parse.model_read_it asks: twenty-nine documents render as
    Latin because their Kruti Dev is neither embedded nor installed, the model
    transcribes the wreckage, and their rows still come from the text layer.
    Those are what an OCR change cannot touch, so those are REGRESSION.
