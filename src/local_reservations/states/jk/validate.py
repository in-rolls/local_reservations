"""Check the parsed J&K reservation data.

J&K has no reliable published seat total to check against, and its holdings are
an ad-hoc set rather than a complete corpus, so the checks here are about being
honest rather than about hitting a number:

* the women's share is only meaningful for a **full roster**. 2018's documents
  list only the reserved wards, so its 82% women is a property of the document.
  That check is skipped for `listing_scope == reserved_only` rather than
  reported as a failure or, worse, as a finding.
* 2016 carries two reservation columns, so the sarpanch count must be far
  smaller than the ward count. If they are close, column 13 was misread as
  column 12 and every ward is being recorded twice.
* 2016 also carries the SC/ST populations the allocation was based on, so
  SC-reserved wards should sit in places with more SC population than average.
  No other state in this repo lets the allocation rule be checked against its
  own inputs.
