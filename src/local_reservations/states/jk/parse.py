"""Parse Jammu & Kashmir panchayat reservation, 2010 / 2016 / 2018.

J&K calls the gram panchayat a *halqa* and its wards *panch constituencies*, so
the two tiers here are `sarpanch` (halqa level) and `ward` (panch level).

Each year is laid out differently, so columns are located from the header row
rather than by fixed index:

  2016  15 columns, and the richest source in this project: district, block,
        halqa, panch ward, SC/ST/OC populations and percentages, and **two**
        reservation columns - one for the panch ward, one for the sarpanch of
        the halqa. So 2016 yields both tiers, and carries the populations that
        the allocation was based on, which makes the rule auditable.
  2010  4-6 columns: S.No, halqa, panch number/name, and either one combined
        reservation cell or separate SC/ST/Women flags. Ward tier only. The
        PDFs are extracted first by extract_2010.py; this parser reads JSONL.
  2018   9 columns: district and block numbers and names, halqa, panch, and one
        reservation column. Ward tier only.

The holdings are ad-hoc - mixed granularity, inconsistent filenames, 2016
covering part of Jammu division and 2018 part of Kashmir - so what matters here
is honest coverage accounting, not clever parsing. validate.py does that.

Writes data/jk/{ward,sarpanch}_reservation_<year>.{csv,jsonl}.
