"""Karnataka's 2016 taluk and zilla panchayat members, from the OCR cache.

Two tiers Karnataka contributes nothing to today. Its existing rows are gram
panchayat reservation rosters for 1993-2007, which name no winner by
construction; these name one on every row, and the party as well.

Reading the HTML is `tables.py`, tested on its own. This is everything that is
about Karnataka rather than about tables: where the district and taluk come
from, which office the seat is, and what has to hold before a row is written.

**The place comes from the filename, and that is a decision worth seeing.** The
document's own header states the district and taluk too, but in Kannada and
through the same OCR as everything else - Siruguppa's own name comes back as
"ಸಿದುಗುಪ್ಪ" on one page and "ಸಿರ್ಯಪ್ಪ" on another. The archive path is exact and
was never scanned. So the filename is the source, and what the printed column
can check is whether a document agrees with *itself* - comparing it to the
Latin filename would score near zero however right the document was.

**The seat numbers are the completeness check.** A taluk's constituencies are
numbered consecutively, so a page lost to a bad read shows up as a gap rather
than as a plausibly short table. Four documents currently lose a seat where a
row straddles a page break, and that is reported rather than smoothed over.
