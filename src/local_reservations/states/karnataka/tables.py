"""Turning Surya's HTML back into the rows the gazette printed.

Kept apart from the parser so it can be tested without a cache: everything here
is a pure function of a page's HTML, and every one of these rules was written
because the naive reading produced rows that looked fine and were wrong.

**Rows wrap, and Surya splits a wrapped row in two.** On Hunagund page 3 every
seat is two `<tr>` elements - the row, and a continuation carrying the tails of
whichever columns overflowed, right-aligned:

    19 | 19-ಕೂಡಲಸಂಗಮ | ಹಿಂದುಳಿದ 'ಅ'   | ಮಹಾಂತವ್ವ ... ಸಾ:      | ಭಾರತೀಯ
       |             | ವರ್ಗ (ಮಹಿಳೆ)   | ಬಿಸಲದಿನ್ನಿ ತಾ:ಹುನಗುಂದ | ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಕಾಂಗ್ರೇಸ್

Read as two rows that is one seat with an unmatchable reservation and no party,
plus a phantom. Merged it is Backward-A (Woman), Congress. 20 of 741 rows in
the first 24 documents are continuations, so this is 2.7% phantom rows and a
similar number quietly mangled - and neither a row count nor a fill rate moves.

**Two layouts.** Most districts print five columns; Ballari and others add the
taluk's name as a second. The mapping keys on the table's width rather than on
its header text, because a continuation page carries no header at all and the
header that does exist is OCR'd like everything else.

That leaves the mapping unverified, so `looks_right` checks it rather than
assuming: the column claimed to be the reservation has to canonicalise on most
of its rows. A wrong mapping fails that immediately - names and party names do
not look like a fixed list of ten categories.

# differ by a single character - ಅ against ಬ - inside an otherwise identical
# phrase. Scored as one vocabulary they sit 0.07 apart, the margin rule refuses
# both, and 93 of the first 700 rows lose their category. Scored as a family
# first they are unambiguous.

# caste_reservation, where confusing a family would change the seat's caste.
