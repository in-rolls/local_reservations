"""West Bengal zila parishad seats, 2018, from the delimitation gazettes.

The smallest state parsed here and the only one with a **draft and a final
printing of the same document for 19 of 20 districts**. Both are parsed and
compared, which is why this is worth doing at its size: two independent scans of
two independently typeset gazettes agreeing on the same seat is the strongest
evidence available that a scanned row was read right, and `printings_agree` is
already a column the master carries and `quality_flags` already reports.

The gazette prints five columns:

    (1) Name of Block
    (2) Number of members to be elected to the Zilla Parishad
    (3) Number, Name and area of the Constituency
    (4) Constituencies reserved for ST/SC/BC persons
    (5) Constituencies reserved for women

Columns (4) and (5) are separate, and that is the whole reason this parser reads
word positions rather than lines of text. Flattened to text, a scheduled-caste
women's seat reads "SC Women", a women's seat reads "Women", a scheduled-caste
seat reads "SC" and an open seat reads as nothing - which works until one stray
word lands between the columns and an open seat silently acquires a caste. The
column boundaries come from the gazette's own `(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)` markers.

**Column (2) is a check the document performs on itself.** It states how many
zila parishad members each block elects. Summed over a district that must equal
the number of constituencies parsed for it, and it is an entirely independent
statement - printed once per block, against constituencies enumerated one by
one. A parser that drops or invents a row fails it.
