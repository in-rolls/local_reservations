"""OCR the West Bengal zila parishad gazettes, keeping word positions.

These are scans, and the thing that has to be read off them is *which column a
word sits in*: the caste reservation and the women's reservation are two
separate columns, and a page where they are flattened into a line of text says
"SC Women" for a seat reserved for a scheduled caste woman and "Women" for one
reserved only for a woman - but also "SC" for one reserved only for a scheduled
caste, and nothing at all for an open seat. Reading that as running text works
until a stray word lands between them.

So tesseract is run in TSV mode and the word boxes are kept. `parse.py` decides
columns from the gazette's own `(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)` header markers, which the
commission prints on the first page of every district's table.

Two things learned the hard way elsewhere in this repository and applied here:

- **Pillow drops the DPI when it saves a PNG.** Tesseract then guesses the
  resolution and mis-sizes everything. `pdftoppm` writes the DPI correctly, so
  its output is passed to tesseract untouched rather than being round-tripped
  through Pillow - the round trip is what invalidated a whole earlier finding.
- **`--psm 4`**, single column of variable-size text, which is what a wide ruled
  table actually is. The default segmentation splits these into blocks and
  interleaves the columns.

The cache is committed, so the parse runs without tesseract installed.
