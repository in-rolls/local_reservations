"""Check the parsed Goa ward reservation data.

2012 is the reference year: it is complete, it covers all 12 talukas, and its
186 panchayats match Goa's published count. So it doubles as the denominator for
the other two cycles - a taluka that returns far fewer wards in 2017 or 2022
than it had in 2012 is a parse failure, not a small taluka. That check is what
exposed Bicholim returning 2 wards out of 125 because its ward numbers are
separated by an invisible soft hyphen.

Hard failures are limited to 2012, since 2017 and 2022 have genuine source gaps:
Salcete and Ponda are published as scans, and no 2017 file exists for Ponda or
Dharbandora at all.
