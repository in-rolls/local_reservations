"""Parse Goa village panchayat ward reservation, 2012 / 2017 / 2022.

Goa reserves at **ward** level. Its sarpanch is elected indirectly by the ward
members, so unlike Haryana or Jharkhand there is no directly reserved sarpanch
seat to collect - the ward category is the assignment.

The three cycles are published in three different shapes, so there are three
extractors:

  2012  panres_<taluka>.pdf   ruled 8-column table, and the best of the three:
                              it names the *elected* representative and the
                              votes polled alongside the ward category
  2022  list-of-validly-...   ruled 6-column table of nominated candidates,
                              with ward and category fused into one cell
                              ("WARD I (Women)"); several candidates per ward,
                              so rows collapse to one per ward
  2017  <taluka>.pdf          no ruled table at all. The ward number and its
                              category are printed on separate lines either
                              side of the candidate row, so this one is read
                              line by line.
