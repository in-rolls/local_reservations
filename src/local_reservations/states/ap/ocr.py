"""Re-OCR the Andhra Pradesh gazettes, because their embedded text layer is bad.

These PDFs already carry a text layer, but it is itself OCR output and it is
wrong in ways that matter: `5C` for SC, `8c` for BC, `t4` for 14, `72` for 12.
Parsing it means repairing those by hand and hoping the repairs are right.

Re-rendering the page and running Tesseract at `--psm 4` (one column of text of
variable sizes, which is what a wide ruled table is) fixes them at the source:

    embedded   44 Alamuru ALAMURU sc(w) t4 Bc (w) UR (W) SC sc (w) BC ...
    re-OCR     44 Alamuru ALAMURU SC(W) 14 BC(W)  UR(W)  SC sc(w)  BC ...

`--psm 6` is much worse here - it reads the table rules as pipe characters and
garbles the row - so the mode matters more than the engine.

This also unlocks Anantapur, whose PDF has no text layer at all.

Output is cached as data/ap/ocr/<stem>.txt with a form feed between pages, so it
drops straight into the same page-splitting the parser already does, and a
re-parse costs nothing.

# The second pass, and the reason for it.
#
# psm 4 keeps the layout, which the parser reads positionally, and pays for it
# by gluing the table's rules onto the cells: the gender marker comes back as
# "IBC)", "|URW)", "[URW", "JURG)" - the opening bracket read as I, |, [ or J -
# and where the whole marker is lost the parser sees a bare "UR" and cannot
# tell an open seat from one whose marker did not survive. 1,754 ward rows sit
# in that state, and they are not lost at random: Nellore, Prakasam and
# Anantapur mark both the women's and the open seats, so a bare code there is
# unknown rather than male, and a women's share computed over them is biased
# rather than merely noisy.
#
# psm 11 - sparse text, no particular order - reads the same page far more
# cleanly: 229 markers against 62 unreadable ones on the page this was measured
# on. It cannot replace psm 4 because it destroys the layout. So it is used as
# a second opinion, matched back by position.

    A plain str.replace is not positional: "sc)" would rewrite every occurrence

    is bounded on whitespace and on the pipe characters the table rules leave
    behind.

    And the parser reads this text *by character column* - it is a ruled grid
    of twenty ward cells and the column is the ward number. A replacement that
    is longer than what it replaces shifts every cell after it on that line.
    "[URW" -> "UR(W)" is one character wider and "sc)" -> "SC(W)" is two, and
    the first version of this quietly cost Alurupadu three of its eight wards
    while every aggregate - markers found, women's share - moved the right way.
