"""Bihar 2016, from the sibling's re-collection of the archived results form.

The original 2016 scrape kept its rows and nothing else: no document, no page,
no codes, and no statement of which election it covered. The adapter that read
it had to work around all of that - key seats on a ward's printed name because
there was no ward code, fold 651 seats the scrape had captured twice and guess
which reading was later, and declare the year from outside the data.

The sibling has since re-collected the same form and kept every page: 258,095
seats, 644,865 candidate rows and 258,742 saved responses, validated against a
declared schema and compared cell for cell with the original scrape, which
agrees on 644,849 of its 644,958 distinct rows. So none of those workarounds
are needed here. A seat is identified by the codes the form itself uses, the
year is stated in the release manifest, and a row points at the page it came
from.

Two things this still has to get right.

**A seat with no stated reservation is not an unreserved seat.** The form
prints no reservation on a page that answers "Record not Found", and 30,764 of
the 258,095 seats answer that way. They are counted and left out rather than
entering the corpus as open seats.

**A tie that nothing resolves names no winner.** The 2016 form has no winner
flag, so a winner is the uncontested candidate, the one the form marks as
having drawn the lot, or the highest vote. Where two candidates share the top
vote and no lot is marked, the release names nobody and says why in
`winner_note`; 402 seats are in that position and carry no winner here either.

**Twenty-one samiti and zila parishad seat numbers are listed twice**, under
dropdown codes differing only in how the number is padded - "Tardih/01" and
"Tardih/1". In nineteen of them exactly one code carries results and the other
answers "Record not Found", which is what one seat entered twice looks like; in
two, both carry results. Which code is the seat cannot be settled from the form,
so both rows are kept and the corpus's collision ledger records them.

Bihar elects a gram kachahari - a village court - beside the gram panchayat, so
its sarpanch and panch are not this state's gram panchayat head and ward.
