"""Bihar 2021, from the sibling's manifested six-office release.

Until now this adapter took the mukhiya table alone, because that was the only
release the sibling published: 8,067 seats out of 247,671, and not one of them
carrying a reservation, because the mukhiya release held no reservation table.

The sibling now publishes the whole general election - ward member, panch,
mukhiya, sarpanch, samiti member and zila parishad member - with a seat frame
validated against the portal's own district totals, and a seat-reservation
feed. So this reads all six offices and states their reservations.

Two things this has to get right.

**The reservation feed is undated.** It is the portal's 2021-2026 term feed and
its year field is null, which the sibling says in its README rather than
quietly filling in. Reservations are fixed for the term, so the reservation a
seat carries there is the one it was elected under in 2021, and the
by-elections that followed reused it. That is the claim; it is written here
rather than implied, and `reservation_dating` marks every row it applies to.

**The feed and the dated frame agree on the seat, not on the geography.** Join
them on post and unit and all 247,671 seats match; join on district, block,
panchayat and seat number and 12,255 do not, because the upper tiers leave
parts of that path empty. The unit id is the seat's identity here.

Bihar elects a gram kachahari - a village court - beside the gram panchayat,
so sarpanch and panch are not this state's gram panchayat head and ward:
`canon.TIER_BY_STATE` maps them to the kachahari tiers, and POSTS below follows
the same mapping for the portal's post ids.
