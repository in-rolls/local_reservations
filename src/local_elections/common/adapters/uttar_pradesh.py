"""Uttar Pradesh, from local_elections_up.

Gram panchayat heads for four cycles - 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2021 - and the only
sibling whose rows can claim page-level provenance: the 2010 parse kept both
`original_filename` and `page`, so a row points at the sheet it was read from.
2005 kept the page but not the file, so it is `document`.

Two shapes in one state. 2005 and 2010 are one row per seat with the winner
already on it. 2021 is one row per **candidate** - 373,096 of them over 49,772
panchayats - and it marks विजेता and उपविजेता, so both the winner and the runner
up are stated rather than inferred. It records no vote total, only
`vote_percentage`, so there is no margin: a stated second place with no margin
is the honest shape of that file, and better than turning a percentage back into
a count.

The `_fixed` files are used for 2005 and 2010, not the originals. They carry
`gp_res_status_fin_eng`, the reservation already normalized to English, and
`gp_name_fin`, the panchayat name already cleaned. Reading the raw columns
instead would mean re-solving both problems worse.

Two things worth naming:

`Unknown` is not a category. 1,239 rows in 2005 and 32 in 2010 read that way,
meaning the cell did not survive the scan. They carry no caste and no gender
rather than defaulting to unreserved, and `gender_stated` is 0 for them, so
`quality_flags` says so on every one.

The panchayat is numbered in its own name in 2021 - `1-नन्हेड़ा अल्यारपुर` -
and the number is split off, because a name that carries its serial is
unjoinable to the same panchayat printed without one in 2005 and 2010.
