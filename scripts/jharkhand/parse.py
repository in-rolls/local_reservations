"""Parse Jharkhand panchayat reservation, 2015.

One folder per district. The filenames suggest a tier ("GARHWA MUKHIYA.pdf")
but they lie: several are named "RANCHI ZP PSS MUKHIYA GPS" and hold the Zila
Parishad, Panchayat Samiti, Mukhiya and ward-member lists one after another.
Trusting the filename gave 12,509 "mukhiya" seats against Jharkhand's ~4,345
gram panchayats.

So every PDF is read once and each row is assigned a tier from its *post*
column, and each tier is written to its own file:

    eqf[k;k              mukhiya            gram panchayat head   <- GP level
    xzke iapk;r lnL;     ward_member        gram panchayat ward
    iapk;r lfefr lnL;    panchayat_samiti   block
    ftyk ifj"kn lnL;     zila_parishad      district

Two things make this state different from Goa:

* **Caste and gender are separate columns** - column 3 is "vuqlwfpr tutkfr",
  column 4 is "efgyk" or "vU;" - so the shared normalizer's caste_of() and
  woman_of() are called directly rather than normalize_reservation().
* **There is no English printing.** Everything is legacy Kruti Dev, so person
  and place names come out as mojibake. The reservation decodes fine, being a
  closed vocabulary, and each seat is still uniquely keyed by (district, block
  number, seat number) from the last column.
