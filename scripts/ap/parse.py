"""Parse Andhra Pradesh gram panchayat reservation, 2020.

One gazette per district. Pages 10 onward hold "Details of Reservations for the
Office of Sarpanches & Ward Members", one line per gram panchayat:

    44 Alamuru ALAMURU sc(w) t4 Bc (w) UR (W) SC sc (w) BC UR (W) UR ...
    |  |       |       |     |  |
    |  mandal  GP      |     |  the wards, one category each
    |                  |     number of wards
    serial             the sarpanch's own reservation

...but only in some districts. Krishna prints the count before the sarpanch's
cell on some of its pages and after it on others, and Nellore puts a revenue
division in front of the mandal and numbers the panchayats within it.

Two things make this the hardest state in the repo:

**The text layer is OCR output, and it is wrong in places.** `5C` for SC, `8c`
for BC, `t4` for 14, `72` for 12, `UR {W)` with a brace. The category vocabulary
is closed - UR, SC, ST, BC, each optionally "(W)" - so the damage is repairable,
but a repair that is wrong looks exactly like one that is right. Every row
therefore carries `ocr_repaired`, counting how many of its cells had to be
mended, so the doubtful rows can be found again.

**There are no ruled tables**, so the line is read positionally. The mandal and
the gram panchayat are separated only by case: the mandal is Title Case and the
gram panchayat is UPPERCASE.

    Two conventions run through these gazettes and they cannot be told apart

    Prakasam mark both - UR(G) as well as UR(W) - so there a bare UR is a code
    whose marker did not survive the scan, and calling it a man's seat is an
    invention rather than a reading.

    The difference is worth thousands of rows. Anantapur read 38% women against
    a statutory half until the hyphen and run-on forms of the marker were
    recognised; what is left is genuinely absent from the page, and the honest
    answer is that we do not know, not that it was a man.

    **The convention is decided per page, not per document.** Prakasam does both
    - open the file to page 14 and every open seat is a bare UR with no (G) in
    sight, while other pages mark them - so judging the whole document by its
    majority marked 2,431 rows unknown that the page had stated perfectly
    clearly. Krishna's ward count moves between pages of one document for the
    same reason: these gazettes are assembled from sheets typeset separately.

    Left alone this counted 432 seats twice, and the duplication was invisible
