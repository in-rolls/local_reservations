"""One rate-limited HTTP session, shared by everything here that fetches.

Four scripts talk to the web - archive_sweep, harvest_archive, probe_sources,
build_coverage - and each used to roll its own retry loop. They all now come
through `get()`.

**Why this exists rather than a sleep loop.** The archive sweep once reported
Gujarat at 614 archived PDFs and, an hour later, at 0; Odisha 817 then 0;
Mizoram 0 then 168. Nothing changed in the archive. Its retry loop caught every
transport error and returned an empty list, so a rate-limited query and a state
with no web presence produced the same value. That is the bug this module makes
unrepresentable: a request that could not be answered raises `Unanswered`, and
an empty answer is an empty answer.

**And the stakes are not a wrong CSV cell.** The Internet Archive states its
terms plainly - CDX requests are limited to an average of 60/min, and "if 429s
are ignored for more than a minute we block the IP at the firewall (no
connection) for 1 hour", doubling on each repeat. A hand-rolled
`sleep(5 * attempt)` never reads `Retry-After`, which is the one thing the
server tells you and the one thing that avoids the ban.

So the pacing and the backoff are the same object:

- `LimiterAdapter` subclasses `HTTPAdapter`, so `max_retries=Retry(...)` rides
  along with the token bucket rather than fighting it
- `Retry(respect_retry_after_header=True)` sleeps as long as the server asks
- `limit_statuses=(429,)`, its default, makes the limiter also rewind its own
  log when a 429 arrives - proactive pacing and reactive backoff together
- per-host buckets, so pacing web.archive.org does not throttle a liveness
  check against a state commission's own site

**Known limit: the bucket is per-process.** Two of these scripts running at once
each get their own budget and together exceed the ceiling - which is exactly how
the contradictory sweep happened, a hand query racing a background run. Do not
run two at once. If that stops being enough, pyrate_limiter.SQLiteBucket shares
a bucket across processes and is the next move.

Named `fetch` and not `http`: this directory goes on sys.path[0], and a module
called `http` here shadows the standard library's `http` package for every
import after it - including `requests`, which imports `http.client`.
