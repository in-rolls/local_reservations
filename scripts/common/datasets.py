"""Find the parsed datasets. One implementation, deliberately.

Four modules independently globbed `data/*/*.csv` and decided what counted as a
parsed dataset by testing for the schema columns: build_coverage.parsed_datasets,
build_coverage.datasets, expectations.datasets and
build_state_readmes.dataset_files. Four copies of a rule is four chances for one
of them to disagree, and the pooled master is about to write files that match
that rule exactly - `data/master/master_haryana.parquet` carries every schema column
by construction, so each of those globs would have reported it as a state called
"Master" and counted every row twice.

Directories that hold derived output rather than a state's parse are excluded
here, in one place.

    behaves differently in memory than after a round trip through the CSV, and
    the checks were written against rows read back from disk. The columns it
    drops need the same treatment, or the first check to call .strip() on one of
    them dies - which is exactly what happened.

    `seat_members` is dropped rather than stringified: it is the whole candidate
    list, it belongs in the candidate table, and str() of it would be a
    kilobyte of nothing per row.

    The panchayat's alias columns are dropped too. `to_master` has already
    coalesced them into `gram_panchayat`, and carrying `halqa` back alongside it
    re-creates exactly the ambiguity `alias_family_exclusive` exists to forbid -
    Jammu & Kashmir writes the same name in both, and `canon.unit_name` raises

    comes from adapters, and a worklist that says "generated from the rows and
    cannot go stale" while being blind to most of the rows is worse than one
    that admits its scope: it reports a small number of problems and reads as
    though that is all there are.

    Yields (dataset_id, rows) rather than (path, rows) - a pooled slice has no
    single file behind it, and pretending otherwise is what would make
    provenance checks resolve against the wrong root.

    Each row is the master projection **over** the row it came from, not instead
    of it. The projection keeps 36 declared columns and drops everything else to
    master_extras.parquet, and the checks need what it drops: `caste_share_vs_
    population` reads pop_sc and pop_total, `no_ward_column_in_the_source` reads
    ward_count, `seat_id_drawn_as_an_image` reads seat_from_image. Yielding the
    projection alone silently turned the strongest external check available -
    reserved seats sitting where the reserved population lives - from 2 passes
    into 2 skips, and a skip on a large slice is meant to escalate to a failure
    but cannot when the column it needs is simply absent. It went unnoticed for
    a whole phase, including through a verification step that promised no
    existing number would move.
