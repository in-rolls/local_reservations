"""Kruti Dev to Unicode Devanagari.

Jharkhand's notifications are typeset in Kruti Dev, an 8-bit font encoding from
before Unicode. It is not damage and it is not OCR error: every glyph maps to a
Devanagari character deterministically, and "vuqlwfpr tkfr" is exactly
अनुसूचित जाति every time. Left as printed, 11,711 rows cannot be joined to any
other source on name, which is the single largest recoverable gap in the corpus.

Two things make it more than a lookup table.

**The i-matra is written before its consonant.** Kruti Dev stores glyphs in the
order they are *drawn*, so ि precedes the letter it belongs to, while Unicode
stores them in the order they are *spoken*. "fp" is चि, not िच. So the matra is
held back and emitted after the consonant cluster it attaches to.

**Longest match wins.** "Hk" is भ, not ह + क; "{k" is क्ष, not { + क. Scanning
one byte at a time silently produces a different, plausible-looking word.

Verified against strings whose meaning is known from the corpus, pinned in
test_krutidev.py.
