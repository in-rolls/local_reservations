"""Haryana, from local_elections_haryana.

The closest of the siblings to the pooled schema: caste and gender are already
separate orthogonal columns, and district, block, gram_panchayat and ward_no are
all present under those names. What is missing is what the repository's layout
encodes rather than states - the year lives in a directory name and the tier in
a filename.

Two things worth naming:

`BC_A` is not a spelling of `BC`. Haryana reserves panchayat seats for Block A
of the Backward Classes list only, so the local label is finer than the pooled
one and both are kept. 12,515 rows carry it.

889 of the 2022 ward rows are typeset in Kruti Dev while their district and
block are Latin - the panchayat's name and the winner's, in Palwal, Fatehabad
and Jhajjar. Kruti Dev is a deterministic byte mapping rather than damage, so
those names convert exactly: `cueanksjh` is बनमंदोरी and `ujsUnz dqekj` is
नरेन्द्र कुमार. Left as printed they could not be joined to any other source on
name, which is the whole point of holding a name. The conversion happens here,
on read, rather than in the sibling: this repository does not write to its
siblings, and `reservation_raw` keeps what the file actually said.

There is no `source_page`. The parser recorded which notification each row came
from but not the page within it, so provenance_level is `document`: a row can be
traced to a PDF and not to a page. That is recoverable by re-parsing and is on
the worklist rather than papered over.

# Moved once, deliberately, for the v0.2.1 correction: the sibling's parser was
# deleting rows whose category it could not read and shifting every field right
# where the English printing writes "Ward 1" for "1". 2016 gained 261 ward rows
# and 11 panchayats; 2022 lost 30 ward rows, which is what stopping a
# double-read costs. Changing these numbers is meant to be a decision, which is
# why the build refuses until somebody makes it.
