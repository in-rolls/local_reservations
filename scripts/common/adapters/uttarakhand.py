"""Uttarakhand, from local_elections_uttarakhand.

Three cycles - 2008, 2014, 2019 - across three rural tiers, in one file plus a
second holding Haridwar alone. The districts do not overlap, so the two are read
together rather than one being preferred.

The file is candidate-level with the seat's result denormalised onto every row:
each candidate carries the winner's name and votes, the runner-up's name and
votes, and the margin, all repeated. That is the shape this repository's wide
and long tables were built for - the seat facts come off any row of the seat,
the candidates are the rows themselves - so nothing has to be inferred here.
`winner_basis` is `published` throughout.

The work is the reservation vocabulary. Uttarakhand abbreviates with a
Devanagari zero where a full stop would go: `अनु0जा0महिला`, `अ0पि0व0महिला`,
`अनु0ज0जा0`. 28 spellings of four categories, and 1,228 rows of them read as no
category at all until `normalize.py` covered them. Two read as the *wrong*
category - `अनु0ज0जाति` is janjati abbreviated, and the jati pattern matched it
first. That fix lives in normalize with the rest of the Devanagari, not here,
because Uttarakhand is not the only state that will print these.

Provenance is `dataset`: the parse recorded no document and no page.
