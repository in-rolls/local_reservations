"""Bihar, from local_elections_bihar.

The largest single source in the corpus and the first candidate-level one:
645,605 candidates contesting 219,119 seats in the 2016 panchayat general
election, scraped from the State Election Commission's public candidate viewer.
It is the reason `collapse.py` exists, and the reason the candidate table does.

Six posts across two bodies. Bihar elects a **gram kachahari** - a village court
- alongside the gram panchayat, over the same geography, on the same day. Its
head is the *sarpanch* and its members are *panch*. The panchayat's head is the
*mukhiya* and its members are ward members. So the file called `sarpanch.csv`
is not this state's gram panchayat heads, and `canon.TIER_BY_STATE` says so:
7,916 sarpanch seats pooled as `gp_head` would overstate India's gram panchayat
heads by that much with nothing anywhere to flag it.

Four things this adapter has to get right, all of which fail silently:

**The seat key is four columns, not the `number` column.** `number` reads
`Piprasi/SEMRA LABEDAHA/01` - block, panchayat, serial - with no district. Two
blocks in different districts share a name, so keying on it would merge their
seats and the row count would stay entirely plausible.

**The ward number, not the ward name.** `ward` reads `1 - SRIPATNAGAR`. Keyed on
the name alone, panch and ward member collapse to 58,474 and 60,703 seats with
13,191 and 13,666 reservation conflicts; keyed on the number as well, to 93,341
and 98,131 with none. The conflicts were the signal - two differently-numbered
wards that happen to share a name are not one seat.

**A plain reservation label means not-woman, not silent.** The vocabulary is
closed and paired: every category appears both plain and with `(महिला)`. That is
what licenses reading `पिछड़ा वर्ग` as an unreserved-for-women backward-class
seat, and it is why `gender_stated` is 1 here. 328 rows read `--select--`,
carry no category at all, and are left blank rather than defaulted.

**The scrape captured 651 seats twice.** Those rows are not identical - the
same candidate appears with two different vote counts, usually a few apart and
occasionally far apart, which is what a results page read twice during counting
looks like. 1,098 rows fold away on (serial, name) keeping the higher count;
54 rows where one serial carries two different names are left alone, because
which is the duplicate is not knowable from the file. Both the fold and the
leftovers are flagged on the seat rather than silently applied.

**Year is stated nowhere in the data.** The scrape covered one election and did
not record which. It is declared here, cited to the repository, and would be
wrong in exactly the way that never raises if the sibling ever adds a cycle -
which is what `DECLARED` is for.

Provenance is `dataset`: the scrape kept no document and no page, so a row can
be traced to the file it came from and no further.
