"""One catalogue of checks, run per state x year x tier.

Each check declares what it **appeals to**, because that is what decides whether
it can catch anything real:

    internal   consistency of our own output with itself. Cheap, and it cannot
               catch a misread category - the file agrees with itself either way.
    declared   our own declarations in dictionary.py, reference.py, canon.py. It
               catches drift from what we said we expected.
    external   a published total, a statutory share, a population, a second
               printing. The only kind that reliably catches silent corruption,
               because every parser bug in this repository produced plausible
               values rather than an error.

`SKIP` is a first-class status and must render differently from `PASS`. That
distinction is not cosmetic: `rows_in_band` silently skipped Andhra Pradesh's
45,478 wards and Jharkhand's 6,174 - the two largest slices here - for as long
as they had no declared band, and a skip that renders as a pass is how nobody
noticed. So a skipped check on a slice over SKIP_FLOOR rows now fails.
