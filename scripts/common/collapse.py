"""Turn candidate rows into seats.

Three of the sources are candidate-level: Bihar lists every contestant, UP's 2021
file has 373,096 rows over 49,772 panchayats, and Uttarakhand denormalises the
winner onto each candidate's row. Pooling them as-is would count a seat once per
person who stood for it.

**This is the riskiest transformation in the repository**, and not because it is
hard. It is the only step that changes the row count *by design*, so a bug is
indistinguishable from correct behaviour by row count alone - the exact failure
mode this corpus keeps meeting. A wrong seat key does not raise: it merges two
seats or splits one, `reconcile()` still balances because it only counts inputs
against outputs, and the women's share moves by a point nobody can attribute.

Two things contain it, and both are here rather than in the adapters:

- the reservation must be constant within a seat, checked before anything is
  pooled. Every candidate for a seat is contesting the same seat, so they all
  carry the same reservation; if two do not, the key is wrong. Run by hand
  before this module was written: 0 violations across all six Bihar files and
  UP 2021, and **9 of 18,826 seats in Uttarakhand** - the check found something
  real before it was even committed.
- `seat_candidates` on every row, so the denominator is visible. Bihar's
  mukhiya averages 12 candidates a seat; one showing 40, or 1, is where to look.

The winner is the only field that needs inference, and it says which kind it is:
`published` where the source marks the winner, `argmax_votes` where it has to be
worked out - and that one also sets `winner_inferred` in quality_flags.
