"""Karnataka gram panchayat presidents, 1993-2007, from a Stata file.

Five cycles of `Adhyaksha` - the gram panchayat president - over the same 5,855
panchayats, which makes this the only source in the corpus that is a panel. It
is also the only one carrying **per-panchayat Census population**, so it is the
single biggest addition to what can be checked from outside: it takes
`caste_share_vs_population` - the strongest check available here - from 2 slices
to 7.

Read the `caste` value label, not the `reserved_*` indicator columns. Those are
lossy: the non-women indicators do not sum to one per row, and `reserved_w` is
missing for 1,250 rows in 1993 alone. The label states both facts in one code.

**The label has a typo and it is worth stating exactly how it was settled.**
Codes 5 and 6 both read `BC A(W)`. Across all five cycles, code 5 is
`reserved_w=0` on all 4,079 of its rows and code 6 is `reserved_w=1` on all
1,991 of its. Two codes cannot both be the women's category and be split that
cleanly by an independent column, so code 5 is `BC A` and the `(W)` is a
copy-paste. Nothing here relies on the indicator columns otherwise.

Karnataka reserves separately for Backward Class A and Backward Class B, which
is a finer scheme than the single BC other states print, so both are kept:
`caste_reservation` folds to BC and `caste_reservation_local` says which. Codes
11 and 12 read `BC--A OR B` and are genuinely unsplit in the source.

`Upadhyaksha` - the vice president - is dropped rather than filed as a tier. It
is an office the same body elects from among its own members, not a seat.

Provenance is `dataset`: the file records no document and no page.
