"""OCR Karnataka's 2016 taluk and zilla panchayat result notifications.

195 documents, 586 pages, harvested from the Wayback Machine's copy of
karsec.gov.in - 169 taluk panchayats and 26 zilla panchayats. Karnataka
contributes nothing to either tier today; what it has is a gram panchayat
reservation history for 1993-2007, which names no winner by construction.

Every one of them is a photograph. The producer string on all 195 is
`RICOH Aficio MP 5002` - a copier - and pdfplumber extracts zero characters
from page 1 of each, so there is no text layer to prefer and no encoding
question to settle. Surya reads them directly.

**Surya reads Kannada.** Measured on the first page of Badami taluk before
committing to the run: it returned the notification prose and the five-column
table cell by cell, with `<br/>` where the winner's name is stacked above the
address. Its errors are concentrated in a systematic confusion of
sibilants - ಸೂ read as ಕೂ, ಕ್ಷ as ಕ್ನ - which lands mostly on the two closed
vocabularies, the reservation category and the party name. Those canonicalise
against a fixed list. The open field, the winner's name, does not, and its
error rate is what the bench has to measure.

The table is worth more than the tier count suggests. Column 5 is
`ಪ್ರತಿನಿಧಿಸಿದ ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಪಕ್ಷದ ಹೆಸರು` - the party the winner represented - which
almost nothing else in the corpus carries.

Cached to data/karnataka/ocr/<stem>.txt, form-feed separated so page numbers
survive, and committed: the run takes about ten hours on Apple Silicon, so
leaving it out would mean only one machine could rebuild Karnataka.

That ten hours is measured, not estimated. A first estimate of 2.7 came from
timing page 1 of Badami, which is mostly prose over a three-row table; Surya
decodes autoregressively, so a page carrying twenty rows costs several times
as much. 17 seconds a page became 61.
