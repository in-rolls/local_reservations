# Local electoral body reservations

A versioned, checksummed data package of reservation and election-result data
for India's local bodies. Coverage varies by state, year and tier; the tables
below state those limits rather than implying nationwide completeness.

For comparable rural data with one row per seat event, start with the generated
**[pooled master guide](data/master/readme.md)**. State directories also retain
source-specific fields and urban rows that do not enter the rural master.

See **[SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)** for a state-by-state feasibility survey: where
each state publishes its reservation data, whether the files are text or scans,
and what it would take to extend coverage.

The tables below are **generated**. `make coverage` rebuilds them from the
parsed files, `data/inventory.csv`, and the sibling repositories, then checks
every link. They drifted twice while hand-maintained, so they are no longer
hand-maintained.

## What is still missing

The state coverage table and the worklist answer different questions. The
coverage table says what has been parsed and distinguishes missing acquisition
from held source work. Its `Remaining work` column also says when unlinked PDFs
are drafts, duplicate statements, aggregates, manuals, or urban material rather
than missing rural seats.

The worklist describes defects and limits detected in the parsed rows. Open
gaps can be worked now. Blocked gaps need source access. Parked gaps are known
and deliberately deferred. Undetermined entries need source research before
they can be called gaps. Accepted source properties need no work, but remain
visible because they limit what the data can answer.

`Rows affected` is a diagnostic count, not an estimate of uncollected seats.
The same row can trigger more than one note, so those figures must not be added
into a national missing-seat total.

<!-- worklist:start -->

| | Entries | Rows affected |
|---|---|---|
| [Open gaps](WORKLIST.md) | 59 | 82,339 |
| [Blocked](WORKLIST.md) | 0 | 0 |
| [Parked](WORKLIST.md) | 9 | 1,653 |
| [Undetermined](WORKLIST.md) | 18 | 72,403 |
| [Accepted properties of the sources](WORKLIST.md) | 24 | 141,056 |

<!-- worklist:end -->

**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** says what moved between releases and why,
corrections first — if a number you used has changed, that is where it is
recorded, along with which analyses to redo.

Every release is pinned by **[MANIFEST.json](MANIFEST.json)** — a SHA-256 for
every file, the exact master column order, and the commit each sibling
repository was read at. Verify a checkout with `python3
src/local_reservations/tools/verify_manifest.py`, which is standard library
only and imports nothing else here, so it works from a bare checkout or an
unpacked tarball.

## What we have

The table below covers slices parsed in this repository, with one row per
state, year and tier. The pooled files also include parsed sibling repositories
and have one row per seat event. The notes are derived from the rows themselves
rather than written by hand, so they cannot drift from what is in the files.

Each state directory also has its own generated readme — what is in it, which
documents each row came from, what to be careful of, and how to rebuild it.

Read the notes before the numbers. J&K 2018's 82% women is a property of a
document that lists only the reserved wards, not a fact about J&K; Goa's 2017
and 2022 cycles are nomination lists and name no winner; Jharkhand's place names
are still in the legacy font they were printed in.

## Coverage by state

This table inventories every state, including completed sibling repositories.
`Rows` counts records in parsed source files; candidate-level sources may
contain several records per seat, and local files may include urban bodies that
the rural master excludes. Use the pooled master above for comparable
seat-event counts.

`Coverage` says whether rows are parsed, no rows are parsed, sources are not
held, or rural PRI data are not applicable. `Remaining work` records the next
source action or explains why held PDFs do not represent additional missing
seats. The state readme linked in `Where` gives the file-level inventory.
