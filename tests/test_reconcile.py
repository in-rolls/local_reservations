"""The worklist and the master must agree about the same rows.

They are generated separately - the worklist from the notes, the master from the
adapters - and for months they disagreed without anything noticing. The master
reported 9,543 rows that identify no distinct seat; the worklist accounted for
1,425 of them, because it read only this repository's own parses and could not
see a sibling row at all.

A worklist that says "generated from the rows and cannot go stale" while being
blind to two thirds of the rows is worse than one that admits its scope: it
reports few problems and reads as though there are few.
