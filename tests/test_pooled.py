"""What `pooled()` must keep, and why it is a test rather than a comment.

`pooled()` projects every row into the master's 36 declared columns. For a whole
phase it yielded only that projection, and the checks read it: `caste_share_vs_
population` - the strongest external check here, reserved seats sitting where
the reserved population lives - went from 2 passes to 2 silent skips, because
the columns it appeals to are exactly the ones the projection drops.

Nothing caught it. The check did not fail, it skipped; the row counts were
right; a verification step that promised no existing number would move did not
notice a number that had stopped existing. So the invariant is asserted here
instead: a pooled row carries the master's columns **over** the row it came
from, not instead of it.
