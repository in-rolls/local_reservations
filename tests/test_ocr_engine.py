"""The OCR driver's repair and resume paths, without loading a model.

`engine()` is replaced by a fake, so these run in the parsing interpreter and
in a second rather than needing savitr, Apple Silicon and 61 seconds a page.
What is being tested is the control flow around the model - which pages get
re-read, which get repaired, which get marked - and none of that is the model's
business.
