"""Jharkhand's compound seat identifier, pinned to real gazette strings.

The last column of a Jharkhand notification is not a name. It is the district,
the block, the gram panchayat and the constituency number run together:

    XV cksdkjks@08 pkl@18 lruiqj@izk0fu0{ks0 la0&12

Reading it whole cost more than it looked. `block` came out 52-100% blank when
the block is right there in the string; ward rows carried no ward number at all;
and 121 rows collided on a seat key that was nothing but a roman numeral.

Nothing here raised an error before - the column was simply a long opaque
string, and in a corpus that is legacy-font mojibake nobody would look twice.
Every case below is copied out of a notification.
