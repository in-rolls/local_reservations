"""No one person won a tenth of the seats.

Written because a name field can be wrong in a way that every other check calls
healthy. `winner` was published for 17,115 Jharkhand rows in Kruti Dev while the
`script` column said Unicode: the field was populated, the row count was right,
the reservation shares were right, and every gate passed. What it cost was
invisible per row and obvious in aggregate - अनिता देवी appeared 92 times as
`vfurk nsoh` and 55 times as अनिता देवी, so the same woman counted as two people
and anything joining on name was quietly wrong.

The other failures this guards are the ones that put something which is not a
name into a name column: a table label ("ग्राम पंचायत"), a page header
("Election for the post of Sarpanch"), a phone number. Each shows up the same
way - one value repeating far more than a person plausibly could.

A real name does repeat. देवी is a common surname and अनिता देवी legitimately
wins 147 seats across a state, so the threshold is deliberately loose: this is
a smoke alarm for a field that has stopped holding names, not an attempt to
detect duplicates. Placeholders the sources genuinely print - रिक्त, vacant, and
"no nomination received" - are named and excluded rather than allowed to raise
the ceiling for everything else.
